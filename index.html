                        Thank you for visiting my homepage about me!  I am from Denver, CO, born in Orange County, California.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    I graduated in 2009 from Metro State University with an undergrad in Mathematics.  I am wanting to learn to do web development so that I can pursue a career path for the future and develop software.
                </p>
                    Denver is where I want to reside and work, and thankfully it is looking like the next "Silicon Valley".  Tech is the leading industry and learning to code will be nothing but beneficial.
                    I love food so I also like to cook...but eating is better!!!  Sushi is my favorite and also nothing is wrong with a bowl of pho when it is cold outside!
                    Red Rocks shows are great and there are no bugs comparatively in Denver...the mountains are great and if you ski anf golf, Denver is great!
                </p>
